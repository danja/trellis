Browser-based hierarchical ToDo list, backed by SPARQL

Aiming for a semweb-friendly version of [Workflowy](https://workflowy.com)

Something I started ages ago, was in Seki package, pulling out into its own repo.

I'm getting a bit swamped, so why not add another ToDo list app to my ToDo list.

Mostly working, but still needs a lot of work...
