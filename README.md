# Browser-based hierarchical ToDo list, backed by SPARQL

Aiming for a semweb-friendly version of [Workflowy](https://workflowy.com). I'm getting a bit swamped, so why not add another ToDo list app to my ToDo list.

Picking up again in 2021, I need this.

*I started it years ago (was in Seki package). There are obvious similarities with [Trello](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trello), "...a web-based, Kanban-style, list-making application", which started around the same time. Key differentiator is the semweb angle (and I hadn't heard on Kanban at the time).*  

### Status

*detailed status in [devlog.md](devlog.md)*

**2021-03-31** - Picking up again.

Mostly working, but still needs a lot of work...
