  - Goals/Purpose/Aims?
    - loosely-coupled platform
    - facilitate connectivity
      - minimizing impedance mismatch
    - multi-instance
    - everything is configurable
      - monitor everything
        - analytics
    - test everything
    - support information processing
      - doc management, data management, message management
    - refactor description
      - current : Seki is a front-end to an independent SPARQL server using node.js
      - new : Personal Linked Data Platform ??
    - support all my planned apps :)
      - yak shaving not bikeshedding!
    - a target : Linked Data Profile - http://www.w3.org/Submission/2012/02/
      - also http://www.w3.org/2012/ldp/charter#scope
      - http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/wiki/TurtlePatch
    - transparent federated queries
      - point the query part at different stores
        - also different for R/W
    - caching ?? (watch get/update ratio, vary cache size correspondingly)
    - scale 
      - aim for ~10 million triples as typical usage
      - dbPedia ~ 1 billion triples
        - http://www.w3.org/wiki/RdfStoreBenchmarking
      - re-read Fuseki & TDB docs
        - optimiser
  - First Application : serve I Ching data
    - Aim (MVP)
      - provide RDF and HTML representations of all (public) resources at individual deref'able URLs
      - HTML representation will support link-based navigation and representation editing through forms
    - clean source data, convert to rough RDF/XML (nearly done)
    - load data
      - one model for all hexagrams
      - one model for vocabs (pipeline input)
    - serve data
      - page templates
    - edit data via HTML forms
  - Play
    - visualizations: check: http://mbostock.github.com/d3/ex/
  - Requirements (based on suggestions from @ephemerian and @kendall)
    - I/O - that's what it's all about
    - views/editing
      - initially add hoc
      - later Fresnel?
        - http://www.w3.org/2005/04/fresnel-info/manual/ ?
    - authentication 
      - Basic over HTTPS
      - https://github.com/magnetik/node-webid
    - authorization 
      - Private store contains ACL
      - initially 
        - Private store admin R/W only, inaccessible directly
        - Public anyone R admin W
    - logging 
      - text - for debugging (must be a node util available)
      - RDF model - for analytics
    - federation
      - it should be trivial to run federated queries
      - SPARQL repository - prepared queries for e.g. selecting by shared interests
    - bake/unbake
    - caching
    - text search
    - throttling
    - versioning
      - layer on top
    - support for Linked Data API

    - WebDAV
  - Test Framework
    - http://www.w3.org/2009/sparql/docs/tests/

      - use zombie for HTML bits
      - // what would an RDF zombie look like?
    - Design
      - https://github.com/danja/seki/blob/dev/src/tests/notes.txt
  - Common Graphs
    - ACL
    - event logs
    - registry of other services/Seki instances (federation!)
      - VoID
    - SPARQL repository
  - Nice to have
    - data validation
    - rules/reasoning/explanation/statistical stuff (much later!)

    - empty box on a page is a token receiver : □
      - you can drag a token from the bookmarks bar into the receiver
      - (it's actually an <input> field)
    - what to pass across?
      - form associated with the token that you fill in
      - when you pass the token along, it passes the data from the form fields
