  - First Application : serve I Ching data
    - Aim (MVP)
      - provide RDF and HTML representations of all (public) resources at individual deref'able URLs
      - HTML representation will support link-based navigation and representation editing through forms
    - clean source data, convert to rough RDF/XML (nearly done)
    - load data
      - one model for all hexagrams
      - one model for vocabs (pipeline input)
    - serve data
      - page templates
    - edit data via HTML forms
  - Play
    - visualizations: check: http://mbostock.github.com/d3/ex/
  - Requirements (based on suggestions from @ephemerian and @kendall)
    - authentication 
      - Basic over HTTPS
      - https://github.com/magnetik/node-webid
    - authorization 
      - Private store contains ACL
      - initially 
        - Private store admin R/W only, inaccessible directly
        - Public anyone R admin W
    - logging 
      - text - for debugging (must be a node util available)
      - RDF model - for analytics
    - federation
      - it should be trivial to run federated queries
      - SPARQL repository - prepared queries for e.g. selecting by shared interests
    - bake/unbake
    - caching
    - text search
    - throttling
    - support for Linked Data API
      - http://code.google.com/p/linked-data-api/
  - Test Framework
    - http://www.w3.org/2009/sparql/docs/tests/
    - implementation

  - Common Graphs
    - ACL
    - event logs

    - for each of your terms:
      - offer similar terms from Existing (with full descriptions)
        - need similarity measure - algorithms?
      - offer options:
        - sameAs term in Existing
          - (replace) 
            - add advisory annotation to New
          - (reference)
            - add Current term, with sameAs Existing to New

          - copy relevant triples from Current to New
        - genuinely new term
          - copy relevant triples from Current to New

    - http://dannyayers.com/stuff/token-thing/source.html
    - icon on a page is a token : ■
      - you can drag that token to the bookmarks bar
      - (it's actually a link or script)
    - empty box on a page is a token receiver : □
      - you can drag a token from the bookmarks bar into the receiver
      - (it's actually an &lt;input&gt; field)
    - what to pass across?
      - form associated with the token that you fill in
      - when you pass the token along, it passes the data from the form fields
