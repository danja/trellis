# Trellis

Trellis is a User Experience representational model designed for highly interactive Web activity. 
It is based on a combination of the Collapsible Outline (tree) and Card (as in HyperCard) UI components.  

The aims are twofold:

  * allow representation a wide variety of commonly encountered data structures
  * allow evolution in the sophistication of the user interface as data increases in detail
